## Handover: Routing and State Management Refactoring

This document summarizes the refactoring work performed to address the critical architectural issues identified in `BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`.

### Work Completed

The primary goal of this refactoring effort was to replace the manual, state-based navigation system with `react-router-dom` and to centralize application state using React Context.

The following steps have been completed:

1.  **Added `react-router-dom`:** The library was installed and added to `package.json`.
2.  **Created `src/Router.js`:** A new file was created to define the application's routes using `createBrowserRouter`. This file now serves as the main entry point for the application's UI.
3.  **Updated `src/index.js`:** The application's entry point was updated to render the new `AppRouter` component.
4.  **Created `src/context/AppContext.js`:** A new context provider was created to hold the application's global state, which was previously managed entirely within `App.js`.
5.  **Refactored `src/App.js`:**
    *   The monolithic state management and state-based routing have been removed.
    *   The component now uses `<Outlet />` from `react-router-dom` to render the active page component.
    *   The global state is now provided to all components via the `AppProvider`.
    *   Navigation is handled by the `useNavigate` hook.
6.  **Refactored Page Components:**
    *   `src/components/pages/HomePage.js`: Fully refactored to use `useAppContext` and `useNavigate`.
    *   `src/components/pages/ItemDetailPage.js`: Fully refactored to be a self-contained component that fetches its own data based on the `itemId` from the URL.
    *   `src/components/pages/ProfilePage.js`: Refactored to use `useAppContext`.

### Next Steps & Remaining Work

The foundational refactoring is complete, but the work is not yet finished. Most page components are still using the old, broken prop-drilling system.

The immediate next steps are to continue refactoring the remaining page components:

1.  **Refactor all components in `src/components/pages/`:**
    *   There are approximately 48 page components left to refactor.
    *   For each component, perform the following:
        1.  Remove the destructured props from the component signature (e.g., `({ onNavigate, ... })`).
        2.  Import and call the `useAppContext` hook to access shared state and functions (`currentUser`, `cartItems`, `onAddToCart`, etc.).
        3.  Import and call the `useNavigate` hook for any navigation logic.
        4.  Replace all calls to `onNavigate('path')` with `navigate('/path')`.
        5.  Replace all calls to `onItemClick(item)` with `navigate(`/item/${item.id}`)`.
        6.  If the component needs to fetch data based on a URL parameter (like `ItemDetailPage`), add a `useEffect` hook and use the `useParams` hook to get the required ID.

2.  **Update `Router.js`:**
    *   The `src/Router.js` file currently only contains a few routes. All other page components need to be added to the router configuration with their corresponding paths.

3.  **Thorough Testing:**
    *   Once the refactoring is complete, the entire application needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure that all navigation, data fetching, and state interactions work as expected.

This refactoring is a critical step towards making the TuiTrade application stable, maintainable, and scalable.
