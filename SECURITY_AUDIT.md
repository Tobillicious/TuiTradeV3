### 4. **API Security**
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Request validation and sanitization
- ✅ Authentication tokens required for sensitive operations
- ✅ Rate limiting via Firebase (built-in)
- ✅ Error handling without information leakage

### 5. **Frontend Security**
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive config
- ✅ XSS protection via React's built-in sanitization
- ✅ No sensitive data in client-side code
- ✅ Secure cookie handling (Firebase handles this)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

### 6. **File Upload Security**
- ✅ Storage rules for authenticated users only
- ✅ File type restrictions
- ✅ Size limitations (Firebase default)
- ✅ Secure URL generation

### 7. **HTTPS & Transport Security**
- ✅ Force HTTPS in production (Firebase Hosting)
- ✅ Security headers implemented
- ✅ HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- ✅ Content Security Policy headers

## 🔧 Security Headers Implemented

```json
{
  "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
  "X-Frame-Options": "DENY", 
  "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
  "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
  "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
}
```

## ⚠️ Security Considerations for Production

### 1. **Environment Variables**
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Never commit `.env` files to git
- [ ] Use Firebase project configuration for secrets
- [ ] Rotate API keys regularly

### 2. **Monitoring & Logging**
- [ ] Set up Firebase Crashlytics
- [ ] Monitor Cloud Functions logs
- [ ] Set up Stripe webhook monitoring
- [ ] Implement error reporting (Sentry recommended)

### 3. **Backup & Recovery**
- [ ] Set up automatic Firestore backups
- [ ] Document disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Test backup restoration process

### 4. **Domain & SSL**
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate
- [ ] Set up redirect from HTTP to HTTPS

### 5. **Content Security Policy**
- [ ] Implement stricter CSP headers
- [ ] Whitelist only necessary external domains
- [ ] Regular security audits

## 🚀 Pre-Deployment Checklist

## 📋 Ongoing Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks (Monthly)
- [ ] Review Firebase security rules
- [ ] Check for dependency vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Review user access patterns
- [ ] Monitor error logs

### Regular Tasks (Quarterly)
- [ ] Rotate API keys
- [ ] Review and update security headers
- [ ] Audit user permissions
- [ ] Test backup/recovery procedures

### Regular Tasks (Annually)
- [ ] Full security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Dependency updates
- [ ] Review compliance requirements

## 🛡️ Incident Response Plan

1. **Identify** - Monitor logs and error reports
2. **Contain** - Disable affected features if necessary
3. **Investigate** - Analyze scope and impact
4. **Remediate** - Fix vulnerabilities
5. **Recover** - Restore normal operations
6. **Learn** - Update security measures
